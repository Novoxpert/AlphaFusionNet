## 10. Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrency news sentiment provides several important insights for both academic research and practical applications:

### 10.1 Core Conclusions

1. **Predictive Signal Exists:** News sentiment contains genuine predictive information for Bitcoin price movements, with statistical significance across multiple time horizons and methodologies

2. **Model Selection Matters:** Domain-specific models (CryptoBERT) provide substantial improvements over general financial models (FinBERT) for directional prediction accuracy

3. **Source Diversification Benefits:** Different news sources provide complementary predictive signals, suggesting value in ensemble approaches (Coindoo showed best performance in bitcoin prediction)

4. **Optimal Timing Windows:** about 140 hours provides the best balance of signal strength and practical utility

5. **News Informativ Part:** News contain title, subtitle, and content. Titles showed untrustworthy results in Sentiment Analysis and contents had the best performance.

6. **News Length:** About half of news content are longer than 512 tokens which can't be fully covered by 512 token models such as Finbert.

### 10.2 Practical Implications

**For Traders and Investors:**
- Sentiment analysis can provide modest edge in cryptocurrency markets
- Source diversification and model ensembles likely to enhance performance
- Domain-specific model development shows modest benefits
- Multi-source analysis provides richer insights than single-source studies
- Systematic horizon sweeps essential for optimization


### 10.3 Final Remarks

While sentiment analysis provides statistically significant predictive power for cryptocurrency markets, the effect sizes remain modest. Successful implementation requires sophisticated methodologies, careful risk management, and realistic expectations about achievable returns. The demonstrated superiority of domain-specific models and source-diversified approaches suggests continued value in advancing these directions.

# 11. Future Works

1. Using more data points for the same analysis (the current report is generate using bitcoin news in the corresponding dates)

2. Finding more accurate models for news analysis instead of finbert (weak in crypto) and cryptobert

3. Individual Source report is not trustworthy due to lack of sufficient data points in some sources
