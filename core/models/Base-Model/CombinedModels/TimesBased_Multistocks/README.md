## âœ… Conclusion

- The **Transformer + FinBERT + Concatenation** model achieves **higher RÂ²** for most assets and demonstrates better overall correlation to real-world volatility across the tested symbols.
- The **TimesNet + FinBERT + CGAF** model shows **more stable and positive RÂ² on previously negative assets**, suggesting better generalization or regularization in noisier regimes.
- However, **Transformer-Concat clearly outperforms** on major assets like **BTC, XRP, XLM**, which are more liquid and news-sensitive.

> ðŸ”Ž **Conclusion**: For multi-asset volatility prediction using news and OHLCV data, the **Transformer + FinBERT + Concatenation** model currently offers stronger and more consistent performance.  
Yet, **TimesNet + CGAF may hold promise** for datasets with deeper temporal structure or when fused with stronger regularization or asset-specific tuning.
