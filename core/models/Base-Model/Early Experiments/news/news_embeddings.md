# FinBERT Text Embeddings Extraction

## Overview

This notebook implements a comprehensive text embedding extraction system using FinBERT, a specialized BERT model fine-tuned for financial text analysis. The system is designed to convert financial summaries, reports, and other textual data into dense numerical representations that can be used for downstream machine learning tasks such as sentiment analysis, document similarity, and financial text classification.

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Extract high-quality embeddings from financial text summaries using FinBERT
- Provide multiple embedding extraction methods to capture different aspects of text representation
- Generate embeddings that preserve financial domain-specific semantic information

## Methodology

### Model Architecture: FinBERT
FinBERT is chosen for its specialized capabilities in financial text understanding:
- **Domain-Specific Pre-training**: Trained on extensive financial corpora
- **Financial Vocabulary**: Understands financial jargon, terminology, and context
- **Transformer Architecture**: Leverages attention mechanisms for contextual understanding
- **Proven Performance**: Demonstrated effectiveness in financial sentiment analysis and classification

### Embedding Extraction Methods

The system implements three distinct embedding extraction strategies:

#### 1. CLS Token Method (`method='cls'`)
- **Description**: Uses the [CLS] token embedding as sentence representation
- **Rationale**: The [CLS] token is specifically designed for sequence-level tasks
- **Use Case**: Best for classification and sentiment analysis tasks
- **Characteristics**: Single vector per text, computationally efficient

#### 2. Mean Pooling Method (`method='mean_pool'`)
- **Description**: Averages all token embeddings considering attention mask
- **Rationale**: Captures information from all tokens in the sequence
- **Use Case**: Good for general text similarity and semantic search
- **Characteristics**: Balanced representation, handles variable-length sequences

#### 3. Max Pooling Method (`method='max_pool'`)
- **Description**: Takes element-wise maximum across all token embeddings
- **Rationale**: Captures the most salient features from any part of the text
- **Use Case**: Effective for detecting specific financial events or entities
- **Characteristics**: Emphasizes strongest signals, good for anomaly detection

### Implementation Details

```python
def get_summary_embeddings(summaries, model, tokenizer, method='cls', batch_size=16):
    """
    Extract embeddings from summaries in freeze mode
    
    Args:
        summaries: List of summary texts
        model: FinBERT model
        tokenizer: FinBERT tokenizer
        method: 'cls', 'mean_pool', or 'max_pool'
        batch_size: Number of summaries to process at once
    
    Returns:
        numpy array of embeddings
    """
```

## Key Configuration Choices

### Why These Parameters?

1. **Batch Processing (`batch_size=16`)**:
   - Optimizes GPU memory usage
   - Balances processing speed with resource constraints
   - Prevents out-of-memory errors on standard hardware
   - Allows for parallel processing of multiple texts

2. **Freeze Mode (`torch.no_grad()`)**:
   - Disables gradient computation for inference
   - Significantly reduces memory usage
   - Faster inference without backpropagation
   - Prevents accidental model weight updates

3. **Text Preprocessing Parameters**:
   - `max_length=512`: Accommodates typical financial summary lengths
   - `padding=True`: Ensures consistent input shapes
   - `truncation=True`: Handles texts longer than max_length
   - `return_tensors='pt'`: Returns PyTorch tensors for model compatibility

4. **Multiple Extraction Methods**:
   - Provides flexibility for different downstream tasks
   - Allows comparison of embedding quality across methods
   - Enables ensemble approaches combining multiple representations



### Attention Mask Handling
The mean pooling function properly handles attention masks to:
- Exclude padding tokens from pooling operations
- Ensure accurate representation of actual text content
- Maintain consistency across variable-length **sequences**


## Use Cases and Applications

### 1. Financial Sentiment Analysis
- Extract embeddings from financial news and reports
- Train classifiers for positive/negative/neutral sentiment
- Monitor market sentiment across different time periods

### 2. Document Similarity and Clustering
- Group similar financial documents
- Identify related companies or market events
- Create document recommendation systems

### 3. Financial Event Detection
- Identify anomalous or significant financial events
- Detect earnings surprises or market-moving news
- Monitor regulatory announcements and their impact

### 4. Trading Signal Generation
- Convert textual information into numerical features
- Combine with price data for multi-modal trading models
- Create sentiment-based trading indicators


## Integration Considerations

### Downstream Applications
1. **Classification Tasks**:
   - Use CLS embeddings for binary/multi-class classification
   - Implement logistic regression or neural classifiers
   - Combine with traditional financial features

2. **Regression Tasks**:
   - Predict continuous financial metrics
   - Forecast price movements or volatility
   - Estimate earnings or revenue impact

3. **Similarity Search**:
   - Build document retrieval systems
   - Create financial knowledge bases
   - Implement semantic search for financial research
  

## Conclusion

This FinBERT embedding extraction system provides a robust foundation for financial text analysis and NLP applications. The multiple extraction methods offer flexibility for various downstream tasks, while the batch processing architecture ensures scalability for large-scale financial document analysis.

The system's strength lies in its domain-specific understanding of financial language and its ability to capture semantic relationships within financial texts. This makes it particularly valuable for applications requiring nuanced understanding of financial context, sentiment, and meaning.
