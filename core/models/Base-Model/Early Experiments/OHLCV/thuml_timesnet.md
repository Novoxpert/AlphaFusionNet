# TimesNet Financial Time Series Forecasting

## Overview

This notebook implements TimesNet, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for time series forecasting, specifically adapted for predicting Bitcoin (BTC) returns. The project explores the application of advanced transformer-based architectures to financial market prediction, a notoriously challenging domain due to market volatility and noise.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Investigate the effectiveness of TimesNet architecture for financial time series forecasting
- Predict Bitcoin returns using OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Evaluate the model's performance in capturing financial market patterns
- Provide a foundation for further research in deep learning-based financial forecasting

## Methodology

### Model Architecture: TimesNet
TimesNet is chosen for its ability to capture complex temporal patterns through:
- **Multi-scale temporal modeling**: Captures patterns at different time scales
- **Transformer-based architecture**: Leverages attention mechanisms for sequence modeling
- **Temporal convolutions**: Effective for time series pattern recognition

### Data Configuration
- **Input Features**: 12-dimensional multivariate time series (OHLCV + derived features)
- **Target Variable**: Bitcoin returns (`return`)
- **Sequence Length**: 48 time steps (lookback window)
- **Label Length**: 24 time steps (decoder input)
- **Prediction Horizon**: 1 step ahead (short-term forecasting)


## Results

### Performance Metrics
- **R² Score**: ~0.0 (approximately zero)
- **Model Performance**: Poor predictive capability

### Result Interpretation
The near-zero R² score indicates that the model is not capturing meaningful patterns in Bitcoin returns. This result is consistent with:
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Financial markets are largely unpredictable
- **High Noise-to-Signal Ratio**: Financial returns contain substantial random variation
- **Limited Training Data**: Complex models may require extensive historical data

## Challenges in Financial Forecasting

### Market Characteristics
1. **Non-stationarity**: Financial time series exhibit changing statistical properties
2. **High Volatility**: Cryptocurrency markets are particularly volatile
3. **External Factors**: News, regulations, and sentiment heavily influence prices
4. **Regime Changes**: Market conditions can shift dramatically


## Suggestions for Further Research

### Data Enhancement
1. **Alternative Features**:
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   - Market sentiment data (social media, news sentiment)

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Rolling window statistics

### Model Improvements
1. **Architecture Modifications**:
   - Experiment with different layer configurations

2. **Training Enhancements**:
   - Increase training epochs with early stopping
   - Implement learning rate scheduling

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Classification Framework**:
   - Predict direction (up/down) instead of exact returns
   - Multi-class prediction (strong up/up/neutral/down/strong down)

2. **Regime-Aware Models**:
   - Use clustering to identify market states

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Combine multiple models with different architectures


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of TimesNet to financial forecasting, highlighting both the potential and limitations of deep learning in financial markets. While the current results show minimal predictive power, this serves as an important baseline and learning experience. The framework provides a solid foundation for future experimentation with enhanced features, improved preprocessing, and alternative modeling approaches.

The poor performance emphasizes the fundamental challenge of financial prediction and the need for sophisticated feature engineering, robust evaluation metrics, and domain-specific adaptations when applying time series models to financial data.
